              <ul class="bluorb">
              	<li><p>Due to Sabongpro being a match betting site, and for the protection of all, we are only accepting indemnified funds so that the site can guarantee all payouts. As such, we sincerely ask you that you choose one of the many methods that are already active to fund your SabongPro account.</p>

              <ul class="bluorb">
              	<li>
              	  <p>In real-life cockfight betting, each bet would have to find a corresponding match from another person's bet. If for example, you placed a bet on WALA at 1,000 Points at 10/9 odds, sabongpro will automatically help you find a match from another members bet on MERON at 1,000 Points at 9/10 odds. This we called 'NOTE In sabongpro, your opponent is not sabongpro, not the house, but other sabongpro members. If one member account will try to make multiple bets hoping to have them all matched,... they never will.<br />
              	    <br />
              	    NOTE: In sabongpro, your opponent is not sabongpro, not the house, but other sabongpro members. If one member account will try to make multiple bets hoping to have them all matched,... they never will.

              <h3 class="dark textshadowWhite">9. What do you mean by "Your Bet has been accepted but would have to wait for a match?"</h3>
              <ul class="bluorb">
              	<li><p>As in the previous question, you will receive this message when you placed a bet and no match has yet been found. If at any point, while the betting period is still open, another member placed-in a bet, and your bet and the incoming bet is 'ideally match' , these bets will automatically be matched. Bets are processed in the order they are received.</p></li>
              </ul>

              <ul class="bluorb">
              	<li><p>By the term <strong><em>'opponent'</em></strong> we refer to it as <strong><em>'person other than yourself'</em></strong>. So if we are to match your bet to an opponent, sabongpro.com will search for a different person's bet, opposite of yours.</p>

              <h3 class="dark textshadowWhite">12. How is the NET PAYOUT computed?</h3>
              <ul class="bluorb">
              	<li><p>All winnings are subject to 10% House Commission as disclosed in the Terms and Conditions. The Net Payout is computed using the following formula:<br />
              	  <br />

              	  i.e. Bet on MERON of 1000 points at 9/10 odds.<br />
              	  Net Payout = (1000 x (9/10)) - ((1000 x (9/10)) x (10/100))<br/>
              	  = (1000 x .9) - ((1000 x .9) x .1)<br />
              	  = 900 - (900 x .1)<br />
              	  = 900 - 90<br />
              	  Net Payout = 810 Points</p>
